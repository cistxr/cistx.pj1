# 🌐 CISTX – Decentralized Knowledge Civilizations via Discord

**CISTX** is an open system for managing, sharing, and interacting with multi-layered knowledge through a civilization-inspired structure, fully powered by **Discord servers** and a lightweight companion website.

> "Not just a network – a constellation of knowledge civilizations."

---

## 🧬 Core Concept

CISTX treats knowledge as a living ecosystem. Instead of a centralized platform, users join **different Discord servers** representing **Knowledge Civilizations** – each with its own culture, focus, and activities.

The CISTX system includes:

- 🏛️ **Civilizations (Discord servers)** — Themed communities where members contribute, debate, and grow together  
- 🎓 **Learning Tracks** — AI-assisted non-traditional courses hosted within servers  
- 🛒 **CISTX Shop** — Users earn **Points** and exchange them for access, items, or even permissions  
- 🌗 **Data Layers** — Bright / Deep / Dark Data access organized by role and progress  
- 📊 **Ranking System** — Global and civilization-specific leaderboards based on contributions  
- 🎟️ **Organization Tokens** — Users can unlock the right to create their own civilizations  
- 📡 **CISTX Hub** — Central server that connects all users, tracks progress, and facilitates onboarding

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🌐 Web Portal (cistx.org)

A light and educational web interface with:

- General information (About, Documentation, Privacy)
- Access to Bright Data
- Dashboard to monitor user Points and roles
- Form submission for recovery, feedback, and support

### 🛠 Discord Integration

All knowledge operations run inside Discord servers:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| 🛰 CISTX Hub | Central onboarding & coordination |
| 🧠 Civilizations | Themed Discord servers (up to 7 or more) |
| 🤖 Discord Bots | Handle Point rewards, shop actions, access controls |
| 🛍 Shop Channels | Buy courses, recovery tickets, civilization tokens |
| 🧑‍🏫 Course Channels | Guided non-linear learning led by AI and community |

---

## 🏛️ Example Civilizations

Each civilization is a **Discord server** with its own:
- Founding mythos and name
- Specialized themes (e.g., debate, science fiction, philosophy, coding...)
- Governance style
- Internal ranking and mini-events

| Name | Focus | Sample Feature |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Anonymous 7 | Open-source philosophy & crypto | Debate battles |
| NinjaByte | Code, stealth learning | Puzzle-based challenges |
| MetaGaia | Ecology, spirituality, systems | Collective dreaming logs |
| Quantum Minds | Physics, logic, paradoxes | Meme-theory experiments |

> Each server is its own nation, but all contribute to the CISTX meta-network.

## 🔐 Data Access System

| Layer | Name | Access |
|-------|------|--------|
| 🌞 Bright Data | Open Knowledge | Public, free to read |
| 🔷 Deep Data | Strategic Knowledge | Unlock via Point system |
| 🌑 Dark Data | Sensitive / Hidden | Not publicly accessible – acknowledged only |

Access managed via website + Discord roles + Points.

## 🧩 Points & Shop System

Users earn Points by:

- Participating in courses  
- Contributing verified knowledge  
- Engaging in civilization events  
- Hosting approved workshops or translations  

Points can be spent on:

- Unlocking Deep Data  
- Requesting new roles or ranks  
- Gaining course certificates  
- Purchasing the **"Civilization Creation Token"**

---

## 🎓 Learning System

Courses are:

- Non-traditional, AI-assisted  
- Hosted within Discord  
- Multi-layered with assignments, discussions, and mini-certifications  
- Some are universal; others are exclusive to a civilization  

---

## 🛡️ Security & Recovery System

A special Discord server (e.g., **Custodius**) handles:

- Account recovery
- Identity linking between Discord and website
- Security education  
- Acting as neutral validator

---

## 💬 Communication + Expansion

- Main Hub allows chat, ranking, cross-civilization events  
- Civ-specific servers operate independently but report key data to the system  
- The system is **modular**, **expandable**, and **user-governed**

## 💡 Vision

> "In an age of AI, knowledge shouldn't be centralized.  
> It should evolve like life – in cells, in tribes, in civilizations."

CISTX is a hybrid between a knowledge network, a game, a university, and a movement.

Built for thinkers, makers, rebels, and visionaries.
